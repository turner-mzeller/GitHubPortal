      p.lead Are you ready to go public?

      p As a team maintainer for a team that manages this repo, you have the ability to take this repo from <strong>private and hidden</strong> to public. Once it is public, anyone will be able to see the repo, fork the repo, and start submitting pull requests.

      p Things to keep in mind before going public:

      ul
        li Any required legal sign-off
        li Does your repo have a nice README.md file?
        li Does your repo have a LICENSE.TXT file?
        li Are your source files marked with the appropriate open source license headers?
        li Are you proud of the current organization of files and folders?
        li Have you placed information about accepting contributions in the README.md or CONTRIBUTING.md? Consider onboarding with a CLA bot to help manage requests.
        li Have you double-checked that there are no unexpected or private binaries?
        li Is your management team aware of this action?

      p Once a repo goes public it may be exposed on GitHub feeds showing new repos, so if your project is not public or not announced yet, realize that it is hard to turn back.
